'''
The following two lists must follow a standard phone number format within single or
double quotation marks separated by commas like so:

twilio_active_phone_numbers = ['+1xxxxxxxxxx',
                               '+1xxxxxxxxxx',
                               '+1xxxxxxxxxx',
                               '+1xxxxxxxxxx',
                               '+1xxxxxxxxxx',
                               '+1xxxxxxxxxx'
]

twilio_active_phone_numbers are all the purchased active phone numbers in your Twilio account.
However, you are not required to use more than one.

scammer_phone_numbers follows the same phone number format standard. You can also have just one,
but you must separate multiple numbers with a comma.
